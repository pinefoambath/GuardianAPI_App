Guardian Search App
===================================

This app displays a list of recent GOOD NEWS articles in the Guardian website API. I use a set of keywords to make sure your phone only displays happy news that make you believe in the world again :)

Getting Started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
